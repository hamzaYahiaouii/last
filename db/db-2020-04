This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)."}]}},"configurations":{"CVE_data_version":"4.0","nodes":[{"operator":"OR","children":[],"cpe_match":[{"vulnerable":true,"cpe23Uri":"cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:conjur_oss_helm_chart:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","versionEndExcluding":"2.0.0","cpe_name":[]}]}]},"impact":{"baseMetricV3":{"cvssV3":{"version":"3.1","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","attackVector":"ADJACENT_NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","privilegesRequired":"LOW","userInteraction":"NONE","scope":"CHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"HIGH","availabilityImpact":"HIGH","baseScore":9.0,"baseSeverity":"CRITICAL"},"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":6.0},"baseMetricV2":{"cvssV2":{"version":"2.0","vectorString":"AV:A/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C","accessVector":"ADJACENT_NETWORK","accessComplexity":"LOW","authentication":"SINGLE","confidentialityImpact":"COMPLETE","integrityImpact":"COMPLETE","availabilityImpact":"COMPLETE","baseScore":7.7},"severity":"HIGH","exploitabilityScore":5.1,"impactScore":10.0,"acInsufInfo":false,"obtainAllPrivilege":false,"obtainUserPrivilege":false,"obtainOtherPrivilege":false,"userInteractionRequired":false}},"publishedDate":"2020-06-22T16:15Z","lastModifiedDate":"2020-06-25T17:50Z"},{"cve":{"data_type":"CVE","data_format":"MITRE","data_version":"4.0","CVE_data_meta":{"ID":"CVE-2020-11710","ASSIGNER":"cve@mitre.org"},"problemtype":{"problemtype_data":[{"description":[{"lang":"en","value":"NVD-CWE-Other"}]}]},"references":{"reference_data":[{"url":"https://github.com/Kong/kong","name":"https://github.com/Kong/kong","refsource":"MISC","tags":["Third Party Advisory"]},{"url":"https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611","name":"https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611","refsource":"MISC","tags":["Patch","Third Party Advisory"]},{"url":"https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong/commit/dfa095cadf7e8309155be51982d8720daf32e31c","name":"https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong/commit/dfa095cadf7e8309155be51982d8720daf32e31c","refsource":"MISC","tags":["Patch","Third Party Advisory"]},{"url":"https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949","name":"https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949","refsource":"MISC","tags":[]}]},"description":{"description_data":[{"lang":"en","value":"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3. The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. “1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating ‘An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.’ is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a “Patch” link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However, instructions for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions , which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949) Lastly, the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated
